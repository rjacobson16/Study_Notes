### Notes

A set is a collection of unique, unordered elements. A set can be finite or infinite, and can be represented as follows:

A = {1, 2, 3}

*Set A contains the elements 1, 2, and 3*

Common sets:

Natural Numbers = {0, 1, 2, 3...} or {1, 2, 3...}

Integers = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ....}

Rational Numbers = {..., 1/2, 2/2, 1/3, ...}


#### Elements and Cardinality

  Let C = {yellow, blue, red}

  "Yellow is an element of C."

  "Green is not an element of C."

  "The cardinality of C is 3"

Sets can contain other sets. |{}| = 0, |{âˆ…}| = 1
