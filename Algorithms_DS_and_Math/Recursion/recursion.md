# Recursion

  Recursion is when a function calls itself, or less commonly, when a data
  structure contains a smaller version of the same data structure (e.g. trees
  and sub-trees)


## Memoization
  Memoization is a technique used to optimize programs by caching the result
  of expensive function calls. Recursion + Memoization = Dynamic Programming
