  * Worked on a coding challenges for a Front End developer position. For the
  first challenge, I build a UI in vanilla JavaScript which allows heads of household
  to add members to an insurance policy. For the second challenge, I wrote a function
  to fetch and transform data from an API endpoint

## Nov 12

  * PluralSight: Intermediate JavaScript practice
    * JavaScript Objects & Prototypes

    Notes: 4 ways to create an object in JS:
      1. Object Literals
      2. Constructor Functions
      3. Object.create
      4. ES6 classes

      * 1 & 2 just sugar for 3

      Object Properties (writeable, enumerable, configurable)

      * enumerable removes property from Object.keys, for loops, and JSON.stringify
      * configurable turns off changing enumerable and configurable, but not writeable

## Nov 30

  * jQuery review
  * work on websocket project

## Dec 1

  * Websocket project: add animation on landing page, fix some CSS

  * PluralSight: Intermediate JavaScript practice
    * JavaScript Objects & Prototypes

    Notes:
      * `func.prototype`: object that will be the prototype of any instance created using said function as Constructor
      * `obj.__proto__`: prototype of object

## Dec 2

  * PluralSight: Intermediate JavaScript practice
    * Practical design patterns
